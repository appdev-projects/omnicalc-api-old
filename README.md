Let's make the following URLs work:

## Part I: Flexible Path Segments

### Square with flexible path segment

If I visit a URL of the pattern:

```
/flexible/square/[ANY INTEGER]
```

I should see the square of the number in the third segment of the path. I should be able to enter any **integer** in the third segment of the path; but not a decimal number (since if you have a dot in a URL, Rails will interpret what comes after it as a file extension/format).

#### Example

If I visit [http://[YOUR APP DOMAIN]/flexible/square/5](http://[YOUR APP DOMAIN]/flexible/square/5), I should see something like:

```
{"number":42,"square":1764}
```

Depending on what browser you're using or whether you're using something like [the JSONView Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jsonview/chklaanhfefbnpoihckbnefhakgolnmc?hl=en), you might see something formatted more nicely like:

```json
{
  number: 42,
  square: 1764
}
```

To make a path segment **flexible**, start it off with a colon in your route:

```ruby
match("/flexible/square/:the_number", { :controller => "application", :action => "flex_square", :via => "get" })
```

Then, whatever value the user types in that segment of the path will be placed into a special hash that Rails creates and names `params`. The value will be stored under the key `:the_number`, since that's what we labeled that segment in the route.

In other words, if you now visit http://[YOUR APP DOMAIN]/flexible/square/42, then you will be routed into the `flex_square` action and along with a `Hash` called `params` that looks like this:

```ruby
{ :the_number => 42 }
```

After adding such a route and action, try visiting that URL and watch your server log as you do it.

### Square Root with flexible path segment

If I visit a URL of the pattern:

```
/flexible/square_root/[ANY INTEGER]
```

I should see the square root of the integer in the third segment of the path.

#### Example

If I visit [http://[YOUR APP DOMAIN]/flexible/square_root/8](http://[YOUR APP DOMAIN]/flexible/square_root/8), I should see something like:

```json
{
  number: 8,
  square: 2.8284271247461903
}
```

### Random with flexible path segments

If I visit a URL of the pattern

```
/flexible/random/[MIN]/[MAX]
```

I should see a random number that falls between the integers in the third and fourth segments of the path.

#### Example

If I visit [http://[YOUR APP DOMAIN]/flexible/random/50/100](http://[YOUR APP DOMAIN]/flexible/random/50/100), I should see something like

```json
{
  min: 50,
  max: 100,
  random: 84
}
```

### Notes for flexible path segment tasks

**All of the above should work no matter what integers I type into the flexible segments of the path.**

Remember:

 - **Rails places all user input in the `params` hash.**
 - You can use the `params` hash in your actions as you would any `Hash`; `.keys`, `.fetch`, etc.
 - Watch the server log to see what the `params` hash contains for any given request.

#### Your task: Build out flexible RCAVs so that all of these (infinitely many) URLs work.

## Part II: Query Strings

Now, let's build something a little more realistic. Restricting to integer inputs is not very useful for most calculations — how would we allow decimal inputs? We've seens the technique before when we were using the Google Maps API — **query strings**. This is the part of the URL that, optionally, comes _after_ the path; it starts with a `?` and then has a list of key/value pairs. It's basically the URL version of a `Hash`; this:

```
?sport=hockey&dessert=cookies
```

is the query string version of this:

```ruby
{ :sport => "hockey", :dessert => "cookies" }
```

in Ruby. Try copying the above query string and pasting it onto the end of _any_ functional URL in your app, press return, and watch the server log as you do so. What do you observe?

The information ends up in the `params` hash automatically! No need to modify the route at all. Interesting...

Use that to build the following endpoints:

### Square

```
http://[YOUR APP DOMAIN]/square/results?input_number=42.42
```

#### Example output

```json
{
  number: 42.42,
  square: 1799.4564
}
```

### Square root

```
http://[YOUR APP DOMAIN]/square_root/results?input_number=8.3
```

#### Example output

```json
{
  number: 42.42,
  square: 2.8809720581775866
}
```

### Random

```
http://[YOUR APP DOMAIN]/random/results?input_min=3.14&input_max=9.99
```

#### Example output

```json
{
  min: 3.14,
  max: 9.99,
  random: 5.3403
}
```

### Monthly Payment

```
http://[YOUR APP DOMAIN]/payment/results?input_apr=5.42&input_years=30&input_pv=151250
```

#### Example output

```json
{
  purchase_price: 235000,
  percent_down: 3.5,
  apr: 4.35,
  years: 30,
  monthly_payment: 1128.91
}
```

Use the formula seen in the image located at `/public/payment_formula.gif` to calculate the monthly payment. Remember to keep your units straight — we want a **monthly** payment, but the interest rate and term are given in years.
